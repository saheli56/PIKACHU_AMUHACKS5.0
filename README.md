# Civic Mirror

**See the impact of your choices.**

A web app where you play as a leader making tough decisions for a fictional society. Every choice changes the world around you. 

Made for **AMU Hacks 5.0**.

## What is this?

Civic Mirror is like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game, but for civic issues. You face 8 real-world scenarios—like handling protests, setting taxes, or dealing with AI privacy. 

When you choose, three things change instantly:
*   **Liberty:** How free are the people?
*   **Security:** How safe is the society?
*   **Economy:** How rich is the nation?

At the end, you get a **Civic Profile** that tells you what kind of leader you are (e.g., "The Guardian" or "The Visionary"). You can then share a cool card of your results with friends.

## Features

*   **Real Consequences:** Your choices actually change the story and the stats. It's not just a quiz.
*   **Live Feedback:** Watch the radar chart and progress bars move as you decide.
*   **Sound Design:** Engaging sound effects for choices, results, and milestones.
*   **Shareable Cards:** Download a sleek image of your profile to share on social media.
*   **Privacy-First:** Everything runs in your browser. We don't save your data.

## Tech Stack

We used modern web tools to build this:
*   **Next.js 15 & React 19** – For a fast, smooth app experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS v4** – For styling and making it look good.
